## VisemesAtHome

# Experimental

Resonite mod that enables mic-driven visemes on Linux (.NET 9).
Provides a workaround since OVRLipSync has no Linux build.

Download [VisemesAtHome.zip](https://github.com/KyuubiYoru/VisemesAtHome/releases/latest/download/VisemesAtHome.zip) and extract rml_libs and rml_mods into your Resonite folder.


Requires: [OpenLipSync.Inference](https://github.com/KyuubiYoru/OpenLipSync) to build.
